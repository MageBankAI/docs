# Savings API

<Note>
**Capital Optimization**: Enable your AI agents to autonomously invest idle funds into interest-bearing accounts, earning returns on otherwise unused capital.
</Note>

The Savings API allows your agents to deposit USDC into interest-bearing accounts, track earned interest, and withdraw funds when needed - all through simple API calls that agents can execute independently.

## Savings and Investment Model

<Info>
**Real-time Tracking**: All investment values and earned interest are calculated in real-time based on the current interest rate and exact investment duration.
</Info>

Each savings investment includes:

- **Identity**: Unique investment ID and associated agent ID
- **Principal**: Amount initially invested
- **Status**: Current state of the investment (active, completed, cancelled)
- **Interest Details**: Current value, interest earned, and rate applied
- **Transaction Details**: Blockchain transaction hashes for deposits and withdrawals

## Interest Rate Model

<Check>
**Transparent Rates**: Mage offers competitive interest rates on USDC holdings, with current rates always accessible through the API.
</Check>

Key features of the interest rate system:

- **Centrally Managed**: The rate is set at the platform level and applies to all savings accounts
- **Regularly Updated**: Rates may be adjusted based on market conditions
- **No Lock-up Period**: Funds can be deposited or withdrawn at any time without penalties
- **Annual Percentage Yield**: Rates are expressed as APY

## Interest Calculation

<Info>
**Compound Interest**: Mage uses standard compound interest formulas to calculate earnings, with real-time calculation of accrued interest.
</Info>

```
A = P * e^(rt)
```

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial deposit)
- r = Annual interest rate (APY)
- t = Time in years (days/365)
- e = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)

## Investment Lifecycle

<Warning>
**Status Changes**: Only active investments can earn interest and be withdrawn. Once completed or cancelled, investments cannot be reactivated.
</Warning>

The lifecycle of a savings investment includes:

1. **Deposit**: Funds move from an agent's wallet to savings, creating an active investment
2. **Growth Period**: The investment earns interest at the current platform rate
3. **Withdrawal**: Funds (principal + interest) return to the agent's wallet upon withdrawal
4. **Status Update**: Investment status changes to "completed" after withdrawal

## Best Practices

- Check current interest rates before investing to optimize timing
- Use the dashboard to monitor overall investment performance across agents
- Calculate potential returns before investing to compare different scenarios
- Distribute funds across multiple agents for different purposes or time horizons
- Consider regular deposits to maximize compound interest benefits
- Monitor earned interest to inform withdrawal decisions
