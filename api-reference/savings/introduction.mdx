The Savings API enables your AI agents to autonomously invest idle funds into interest-bearing accounts. Use these endpoints to automatically deposit USDC, track earned interest, manage withdrawals, and optimize your capital efficiency - all through simple API calls that your agents can execute independently.

## Savings and Investment Model

Each savings investment in the MageBank system consists of:

- **Identity**: Unique investment ID and associated agent ID
- **Principal**: Amount initially invested (stored with precision of 2 decimal places)
- **Status**: Current state of the investment (active is the default)
- **Timestamps**: When the investment was created and when it was withdrawn (if applicable)
- **Performance**: Current value and interest earned to date
- **Interest Details**: Interest rate (stored with precision of 2 decimal places) and calculated interest amount
- **Transaction Details**: Transaction hashes for deposit and withdrawal operations

## Interest Rate Model

The MageBank platform offers competitive interest rates on USDC holdings. The interest rate:

1. **Centrally Managed**: The rate is set at the platform level and applies to all savings accounts
2. **Regularly Updated**: Rates may be adjusted based on market conditions
3. **Precision**: Stored with up to 2 decimal places of precision
4. **Transparent**: Current rates are always accessible through the API

## Interest Calculation Methodology

MageBank uses standard compound interest formulas to calculate earnings:

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial deposit)
- r = Annual interest rate (APY)
- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
- t = Time (in years)

For continuous compounding (as used in MageBank), the formula simplifies to:

```
A = P * e^(rt)
```

Where:
- e = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)

## How Interest Works

MageBank's interest calculation system:

1. **Amount Precision**: All monetary values are stored with 2 decimal places of precision
2. **Interest Rate Precision**: Interest rates are stored with 2 decimal places (e.g., 4.50%)
3. **Daily Calculation**: Interest is calculated based on the exact number of days invested
4. **No Lock-up Period**: Funds can be deposited or withdrawn at any time without penalties
5. **Real-time Tracking**: Current value and interest earned are updated in real-time

## Investment Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of a savings investment includes:

1. **Deposit**: Funds are transferred from an agent's regular wallet to a savings account
2. **Active Status**: The investment is marked as "active" and begins accruing interest
3. **Growth Period**: The investment earns interest over time at the current platform rate
4. **Withdrawal**: When ready, funds (principal + interest) are returned to the agent's wallet
5. **Transaction Recording**: All transactions are recorded with blockchain transaction hashes

## Best Practices

- Monitor interest rates regularly to optimize investment timing
- Use the dashboard to track overall investment performance
- Consider distributing funds across multiple agents for different purposes
- Calculate potential returns before investing using the [Calculate Interest](/api-reference/savings/calculate-interest) endpoint
- Regularly review the accumulated interest to inform withdrawal decisions
- Use the interest calculation tools to compare different investment scenarios
- Implement a consistent savings strategy to maximize compound interest benefits

## Next Steps

Use the endpoints in this section to manage savings investments. After setting up savings accounts, you can:

- [Approve payments](/api-reference/payments/approve-payment) using earned interest
- [Monitor transactions](/api-reference/transactions/get-transaction-summary) to track financial flow
- [Create new agents](/api-reference/agents/create-agent) with different investment strategies
