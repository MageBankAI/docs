The Savings API allows you to deposit funds into interest-bearing accounts, withdraw funds with earned interest, and monitor investment performance. These endpoints enable you to optimize idle funds by earning competitive interest rates on your USDC holdings.

## Savings Model

Each savings investment in the MageBank system consists of:

- **Identity**: Unique investment ID and associated agent ID
- **Principal**: Amount initially invested
- **Status**: Current state of the investment (active, completed, cancelled)
- **Duration**: Time elapsed since the investment was created
- **Performance**: Current value and interest earned to date

## How Interest Works

MageBank uses continuous compounding to calculate interest, which maximizes returns on your investments:

1. **Current Rate**: Interest rate is set at the platform level and can be checked via the [Get Interest Rate](/api-reference/investments/get-interest-rate) endpoint
2. **Daily Calculation**: Interest is calculated daily and added to your investment's current value
3. **No Lock-up Period**: Funds can be deposited or withdrawn at any time without penalties
4. **Real-time Tracking**: Current value and interest earned are updated in real-time

## Investment Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of a savings investment includes:

1. **Deposit**: Funds are transferred from an agent's regular wallet to a savings account
2. **Growth Period**: The investment earns interest over time at the current platform rate
3. **Withdrawal**: When ready, funds (principal + interest) are returned to the agent's wallet
4. **Completion**: The investment is marked as "completed" after withdrawal

## Best Practices

- Monitor interest rates regularly to optimize investment timing
- Use the dashboard to track overall investment performance
- Consider distributing funds across multiple agents for different purposes
- Calculate potential returns before investing using the [Calculate Interest](/api-reference/investments/calculate-interest) endpoint
- Regularly review the accumulated interest to inform withdrawal decisions

## Next Steps

- [Approve payments](/api-reference/payments/approve-payment) using earned interest
- [Monitor transactions](/api-reference/transactions/get-transaction-summary) to track financial flow
- [Calculate potential returns](/api-reference/investments/calculate-interest) for different investment scenarios
