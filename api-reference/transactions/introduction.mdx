# Transactions API

<Note>
**Financial Analytics**: The Transactions API provides visibility into the flow of funds between your agents and summarizes your financial activity.
</Note>

Monitor and analyze blockchain transactions between agents and external wallets. Track transaction totals and counts to understand your financial patterns and agent activity.

## Transaction Model

<Info>
**Blockchain Integration**: All financial transfers in Mage are executed on the blockchain, providing an immutable record of every transaction.
</Info>

Each transaction in the Mage system consists of:

- **Transaction Hash**: Unique blockchain identifier (txHash)
- **Status**: Current state of the transaction
- **Amount**: Value transferred in the transaction
- **Currency**: Type of cryptocurrency used (typically USDC)
- **Wallet Addresses**: Source and destination of funds
- **Timestamp**: When the transaction occurred

```json
{
  "txHash": "0x123...abc",
  "status": "completed",
  "amount": "50",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "from_wallet": "0xa55B42bA7B639bB9CEc2dB2520aC8Cff588895f6",
  "to_wallet": "0xb66C42bA7B639bB9CEc2dB2520aC8Cff588895f6",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-03T18:52:39Z"
}
```

The Transaction Summary endpoint provides aggregated totals for:

- **Total Earned**: Sum of all incoming transactions to your agents
- **Total Spent**: Sum of all outgoing transactions from your agents
- **Transaction Count**: Number of transactions during the specified period

## Best Practices

- Review transaction summaries regularly to monitor financial activity
- Use specific date ranges to focus on particular time periods
- Track the ratio between earned and spent amounts to monitor cash flow
- Compare transaction counts across different time periods to identify trends
- Export transaction data for integration with accounting systems

<Warning>
**Blockchain Confirmation**: Blockchain transactions may take time to confirm, so recent transactions might not appear immediately in summaries.
