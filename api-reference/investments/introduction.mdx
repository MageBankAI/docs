The Investments API provides endpoints to retrieve current interest rates and calculate potential earnings for investments. These endpoints allow you to make informed decisions about utilizing the MageBank Savings Vault.

## Available Endpoints

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Get Interest Rate" icon="percent" href="/api-reference/investments/get-interest-rate">
    Get the current annual interest rate
  </Card>
  <Card title="Calculate Interest" icon="calculator" href="/api-reference/investments/calculate-interest">
    Calculate potential interest for a given amount and period
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Interest Rate Model

The MageBank platform offers competitive interest rates on USDC holdings. The interest rate:

1. **Centrally Managed**: The rate is set at the platform level and applies to all savings accounts
2. **Regularly Updated**: Rates may be adjusted based on market conditions
3. **Compounding**: Interest is calculated using continuous compounding for maximum returns
4. **Transparent**: Current rates are always accessible through the API

## Interest Calculation Methodology

MageBank uses standard compound interest formulas to calculate earnings:

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial deposit)
- r = Annual interest rate (APY)
- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
- t = Time (in years)

For continuous compounding (as used in MageBank), the formula simplifies to:

```
A = P * e^(rt)
```

Where:
- e = Euler's number (approximately 2.71828)

## Use Cases

The Investment API endpoints can be used for:

1. **Rate Monitoring**: Track interest rate changes over time
2. **Financial Planning**: Calculate potential earnings for different investment scenarios
3. **Savings Strategy**: Determine optimal investment amounts and time periods
4. **Automated Decision-Making**: Build agents that make investment decisions based on current rates
5. **Reporting**: Include interest projections in financial reports

## Best Practices

- Regularly check the current interest rate, as it may change over time
- Use the calculation endpoint to compare different investment scenarios
- Consider the time value of money when making investment decisions
- Combine with the Savings API to implement automated investment strategies

## Next Steps

Use the endpoints in this section to access interest rate information and calculate potential earnings. After utilizing these endpoints, you can:

- Set up [savings deposits](/api-reference/savings/deposit) to start earning interest
- Monitor [savings performance](/api-reference/savings/get-dashboard) through the dashboard
- Manage [agent balances](/api-reference/agents/deposit) based on interest rate opportunities
