# Payments API

<Note>
**Financial Transactions**: The Payments API provides a complete system for creating, approving, and tracking payments between agents on the blockchain.
</Note>

Process and manage financial transactions between agents with automatic approval workflows and detailed tracking. Use these endpoints to initiate, approve/decline, and analyze payments within the Mage ecosystem.

<Warning>
In sandbox mode only agent-to-agent transactions are currently supported. Agent-to-bank account, agent-to-businesses, and agent-to-checkout pages are coming soon.
</Warning>

## Payment Model

<Info>
**Approval Flow**: Payments respect each agent's configured rules, with transactions above certain thresholds requiring explicit approval before execution.
</Info>

Each payment in the Mage system includes:

- **Identifiers**: Unique ID, name, and type
- **Participants**: Sender and receiver agent IDs
- **Status**: Current processing and approval status
- **Financial Details**: Amount, currency, and payment method
- **Metadata**: Timestamps, tags, and contact information

Different approval statuses determine how payments are processed:
- Payments requiring approval remain in "Waiting for Sender Approval" until authorized
- Upon approval, payments move to blockchain processing
- Declined payments are marked as "Confirmed" with a "Decline" approval status

## Payment Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of a payment includes:

1. **Creation**: A payment is registered with sender, receiver, and amount details
2. **Approval Check**: The system determines if approval is required based on agent rules
3. **Approval/Decline**: If required, the payment is approved or declined by an authorized user
4. **Processing**: For approved payments, funds are transferred on the blockchain
5. **Completion**: The payment status is updated to "Confirmed" when complete

## Payment Types

<Check>
**Payment Classifications**: Mage provides distinct payment types to clearly identify the relationship between transacting parties.
</Check>

- **EXTERNAL**: Payments to recipients outside your agent network
- **INTERNAL**: Transfers between your own agents

## Payment Status Flow

<Info>
**Status Progression**: Payments move through several states from creation to completion, with different approval paths based on agent rules.
</Info>

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| New | Created and awaiting approval or processing |
| Pending | In process of being executed on blockchain |
| Confirmed | Fully processed and completed |

| Approval Status | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Waiting | Initial state before approval check |
| Pending | Payment is awaiting additional confirmation |
| Approved | Payment has been explicitly approved |
| Decline | Payment has been explicitly declined |
| Waiting for Sender Approval | Payment requires explicit sender authorization |

## Best Practices

- Use meaningful payment names and tags for better organization and reporting
- Implement proper error handling for declined or failed payments
- Set appropriate approval thresholds in agent configuration based on risk tolerance
- Use the correct payment type based on recipient relationship (INTERNAL vs. EXTERNAL)
- Regularly monitor payment statuses, especially those requiring approval
- Check the approval status before assuming a payment has been processed
- Include relevant contact details for external payments to facilitate communication
