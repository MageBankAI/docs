The Wallets API allows you to interact with blockchain wallets associated with users and agents. You can use these endpoints to check balances and manage wallet-related operations.

## Wallet Model

Each wallet in the MageBank system consists of:

- **Address**: The blockchain address that can receive and send funds
- **Network**: The blockchain network the wallet operates on (e.g., "base-sepolia")
- **Balance**: The current amount of cryptocurrency held in the wallet
- **Asset**: The cryptocurrency type (typically USDC)

## Available Endpoints

  </Card>

## Understanding Wallet Operations

Wallets in MageBank have several key characteristics:

1. **Automatically Created**: Each agent automatically gets a dedicated wallet upon creation
2. **Network Specific**: Wallets operate on specific blockchain networks (mainnet or testnets)
3. **Balance Reporting**: All balances are retrieved in real-time from the blockchain
4. **Fallback Strategy**: Balance retrieval follows a fallback strategy to ensure reliability

## Wallet Networks

MageBank supports the following blockchain networks:

| Network | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| base | Mainnet | Base L2 mainnet (production) |
| base-sepolia | Testnet | Base L2 testnet (development/testing) |

## Best Practices

- Regularly check wallet balances to ensure sufficient funds for operations
- For production use, use the mainnet network ("base")
- For development and testing, use the testnet ("base-sepolia")
- Use appropriate error handling when dealing with blockchain operations
- Consider gas fees and network congestion when performing transactions

## Next Steps

Use the endpoints in this section to manage wallet operations. After checking balances, you can:

- [Create agents](/api-reference/agents/create-agent) with specific funding
- [Deposit funds](/api-reference/agents/deposit) to agent wallets
- [Withdraw funds](/api-reference/agents/withdraw) from agent wallets
