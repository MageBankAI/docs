The MageBank API enables developers to integrate AI-driven financial agent functionality into their applications. This section provides a comprehensive reference for all available endpoints.

## API Base URL

All API endpoints are accessible at:

```
https://api.magebank.ai
```

## Authentication

Every API request must include your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  To get your API key, visit the [MageBank Dashboard](https://www.magebank.ai/dashboard) and navigate to the "Integrate Agent" section.

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses typically include:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "... additional data fields ..."
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON object explaining the error:

```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid parameters or request format |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource does not exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Pagination

For endpoints that return lists of resources, pagination is supported through the following query parameters:

- `page`: Page number (starts at 1)
- `limit`: Number of items per page (default: 20, max: 100)

Example:

```
GET https://api.magebank.ai/user/payments?page=2&limit=50
```

## Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability, API requests are rate-limited to:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 5,000 requests per day per API key

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` status code. The response headers include information about your current rate limit status:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: The maximum number of requests allowed in the current time window
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: The number of requests remaining in the current time window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: The time when the current rate limit window resets (Unix timestamp)

## Explore the API

Explore the various endpoints through the interactive API playground available in each endpoint's documentation. You can test requests directly and see responses in real-time.

## API Versioning

The current API version is v1. When breaking changes are introduced, we'll release a new version and provide migration guides. To ensure compatibility, you can specify the API version in your requests:

```
https://api.magebank.ai/v1/agents
```

The current version (v1) is used by default if no version is specified.
