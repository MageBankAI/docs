# Agents API

<Note>
**Core Feature**: Agents are autonomous financial entities with their own wallets, balances, and transaction rules.
</Note>

Each agent has its own blockchain wallet, balance, and configurable payment rules. Use the Agents API to create, fund, and manage your AI financial agents.

<Warning>
In sandbox mode only agent-to-agent transactions are currently supported. Agent-to-bank account, agent-to-businesses, and agent-to-checkout pages are coming soon.
</Warning>

## Agent Model

<Info>
**Complete Control**: Configure transaction limits, approval requirements, and other rules to precisely control how your agents handle funds.
</Info>

An agent consists of:

- **Identity**: Unique ID, name, and description
- **Financial Details**: Associated wallet address and balance
- **Payment Rules**: Transaction limits and approval requirements 
- **Status**: Current operational status (active, inactive, paused)
- **Metadata**: Tags, creation timestamp, and other attributes

## Payment Rules

<Check>
**Safety First**: Configure rules to prevent unauthorized spending and ensure financial operations stay within your defined parameters.
</Check>

Payment rules determine how an agent can spend funds:

- **Daily Limit**: Maximum amount the agent can spend in a 24-hour period
- **Transaction Limit**: Maximum amount for a single transaction
- **Approval Requirements**: Set thresholds for transactions that require manual review

## Best Practices

- Create separate agents for different purposes or departments
- Use descriptive names and tags to easily identify agents
- Set appropriate transaction limits based on expected usage patterns
- Regularly monitor agent activity through transaction history
- Start with small balances when testing new agents

<Info>
**Blockchain Integration**: All agent wallets are real blockchain wallets, with transactions recorded on-chain for maximum transparency and security.
