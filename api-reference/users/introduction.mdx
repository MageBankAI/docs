The Users API provides endpoints for managing user accounts and accessing wallet balances. These endpoints enable you to check your wallet balance and manage other user-specific data.

## User and Wallet Model

Each user in the MageBank platform includes:

1. **Identity**:
   - Unique user ID (UUID)
   - Name
   - Email
   - Role
   - Organization ID

2. **Authentication**:
   - API key
   - OAuth provider

3. **Wallet**:
   - Wallet address
   - Associated blockchain network
   - Balance (retrieved in real-time from blockchain)

## Available Endpoints

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Get Wallet Balance" icon="wallet" href="/api-reference/users/get-wallet-balance">
    Retrieve the user's wallet balance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Wallet Operations

Wallets in MageBank have several key characteristics:

1. **Associated with User**: Each user has a primary wallet for funding agents
2. **Automatic Agent Wallets**: Each agent also automatically gets a dedicated wallet upon creation
3. **Network Specific**: Wallets operate on specific blockchain networks (mainnet or testnets)
4. **Balance Reporting**: All balances are retrieved in real-time from the blockchain
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Balance retrieval follows a fallback strategy to ensure reliability

## User Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. The key identifies the user and provides access to their data. 

Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
