The Users API provides endpoints for managing user accounts, accessing wallet balances, and retrieving user-related information. These endpoints enable you to check your wallet balance, view payment history, and manage other user-specific data.

## User and Wallet Model

Each user in the MageBank platform includes:

1. **Identity**: Unique user ID and profile information
2. **Wallet**: Associated blockchain wallet for funding agents and receiving withdrawals
   - **Address**: The blockchain address that can receive and send funds
   - **Network**: The blockchain network the wallet operates on (e.g., "base-sepolia")
   - **Balance**: The current amount of cryptocurrency held in the wallet
   - **Asset**: The cryptocurrency type (typically USDC)
3. **Agents**: Collection of AI financial agents created by the user
4. **Payments**: History of financial transactions involving the user's agents
5. **Savings**: Interest-bearing investments made by the user

## Wallet Operations

Wallets in MageBank have several key characteristics:

1. **Associated with User**: Each user has a primary wallet for funding agents
2. **Automatic Agent Wallets**: Each agent also automatically gets a dedicated wallet upon creation
3. **Network Specific**: Wallets operate on specific blockchain networks (mainnet or testnets)
4. **Balance Reporting**: All balances are retrieved in real-time from the blockchain
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Balance retrieval follows a fallback strategy to ensure reliability

## Wallet Networks

MageBank supports the following blockchain networks:

| Network | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| base | Mainnet | Base L2 mainnet (production) |
| base-sepolia | Testnet | Base L2 testnet (development/testing) |

## User Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. The key identifies the user and provides access to their data. 

Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Security Recommendations

- **Never expose your API key** in client-side code or public repositories
- Store your API key securely in environment variables or a secrets manager
- Use a separate API key for development and production environments
- Limit API key permissions to only what is necessary
- Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

## Best Practices

- Regularly check wallet balances to ensure sufficient funds for operations
- For production use, use the mainnet network ("base")
- For development and testing, use the testnet ("base-sepolia")
- Use appropriate error handling when dealing with blockchain operations
- Consider gas fees and network congestion when performing transactions
- Review payment history for unauthorized transactions
- Export payment data periodically for record-keeping and accounting

## Next Steps

Use the endpoints in this section to manage user-related operations. After accessing user data, you can:

- [Create agents](/api-reference/agents/create-agent) to automate financial operations
- [Process payments](/api-reference/payments/register-payment) between agents
- [Set up savings](/api-reference/savings/deposit) to earn interest on idle funds
