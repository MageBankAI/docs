The Users API provides endpoints for managing user accounts, accessing wallet balances, and retrieving user-related information. These endpoints enable you to check your wallet balance, view payment history, and manage other user-specific data.

## User and Wallet Model

Each user in the MageBank platform includes:

1. **Identity**:
   - Unique user ID (UUID)
   - Name (character varying)
   - Email (character varying, unique)
   - Role (character varying)
   - Organization ID (character varying)

2. **Authentication**:
   - Password (character varying, may be null for OAuth users)
   - API key (text, unique)
   - OAuth provider (text)

3. **Wallet**:
   - Wallet address (character varying)
   - Associated blockchain network
   - Balance (retrieved in real-time from blockchain)

4. **Status and Timestamps**:
   - Status (text, constrained to "Pending" or "Done", default "Pending")
   - Created at (timestamp without timezone)
   - Updated at (timestamp without timezone)

## Available Endpoints

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Get Wallet Balance" icon="wallet" href="/api-reference/users/get-wallet-balance">
    Retrieve the user's wallet balance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Wallet Operations

Wallets in MageBank have several key characteristics:

1. **Associated with User**: Each user has a primary wallet for funding agents
2. **Automatic Agent Wallets**: Each agent also automatically gets a dedicated wallet upon creation
3. **Network Specific**: Wallets operate on specific blockchain networks (mainnet or testnets)
4. **Balance Reporting**: All balances are retrieved in real-time from the blockchain
5. **Fallback Strategy**: Balance retrieval follows a fallback strategy to ensure reliability

## User Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. The key identifies the user and provides access to their data. 

Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## User Status

Users in MageBank have two possible statuses:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pending | Initial status when user account is created but not fully activated |
| Done | User account is fully activated and ready for use |

## Notifications

Users can receive notifications through the platform (stored in the `notifications` table):

- **Content**: Text message describing the notification
- **Read Status**: Boolean flag indicating whether the notification has been read
- **Timestamps**: When the notification was created and updated

## Security Recommendations

- **Never expose your API key** in client-side code or public repositories
- Store your API key securely in environment variables or a secrets manager
- Use a separate API key for development and production environments
- Limit API key permissions to only what is necessary
- Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

## Best Practices

- Regularly check wallet balances to ensure sufficient funds for operations
- For production use, use the mainnet network ("base")
- For development and testing, use the testnet ("base-sepolia")
- Use appropriate error handling when dealing with blockchain operations
- Consider gas fees and network congestion when performing transactions
- Review payment history for unauthorized transactions
- Export payment data periodically for record-keeping and accounting

## Next Steps

Use the endpoints in this section to manage user-related operations. After accessing user data, you can:

- [Create agents](/api-reference/agents/create-agent) to automate financial operations
- [Process payments](/api-reference/payments/register-payment) between agents
- [Set up savings](/api-reference/savings/deposit) to earn interest on idle funds
