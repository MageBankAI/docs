The Users API provides endpoints for managing user accounts and accessing user-related information. These endpoints enable you to retrieve wallet balances, payment history, and other user-specific data.

## User Model

The MageBank platform maintains user accounts with the following characteristics:

1. **Identity**: Unique user ID and profile information
2. **Wallets**: Associated cryptocurrency wallets for funding agents
3. **Agents**: Collection of AI financial agents created by the user
4. **Payments**: History of financial transactions involving the user's agents
5. **Savings**: Interest-bearing investments made by the user

## Available Endpoints

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Get Wallet Balance" icon="wallet" href="/api-reference/wallets/get-wallet-balance">
    Retrieve the user's wallet balance
  </Card>
  <Card title="List User Payments" icon="credit-card" href="/api-reference/payments/get-user-payments">
    Get all payments related to the user's agents
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## User Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. The key identifies the user and provides access to their data. 

Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Security Recommendations

- **Never expose your API key** in client-side code or public repositories
- Store your API key securely in environment variables or a secrets manager
- Use a separate API key for development and production environments
- Limit API key permissions to only what is necessary
- Rotate API keys periodically for enhanced security
- Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity

## Best Practices

- Check wallet balances before creating agents or processing payments
- Regularly review payment history for unauthorized transactions
- Utilize the Export Payments endpoint for record-keeping and accounting
- Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- Consider setting up webhooks for real-time notifications (if available)

## Next Steps

Use the endpoints in this section to manage user-related operations. After accessing user data, you can:

- [Create agents](/api-reference/agents/create-agent) to automate financial operations
- [Process payments](/api-reference/payments/approve-payment) between agents
- [Set up savings](/api-reference/savings/deposit) to earn interest on idle funds
