## How Interest Works

The Savings Vault uses a compound interest model to grow your savings:

- **Interest Rate**: The current APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is displayed on the dashboard can be updated to as high as 12.5%
- **Real-time Calculation**: Interest accrues continuously and is calculated in real-time
- **No Lock-up Period**: Funds can be deposited or withdrawn at any time without penalties
- **Interest Disbursement**: Interest is added directly to your investment's current value

### Interest Calculation Formula

Your interest is calculated using the standard compound interest formula:

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
```

Where:
- A = Final amount
- P = Principal (initial deposit)
- r = Annual interest rate (APY)
- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
- t = Time (in years)

For the MageBank Savings Vault, interest is compounded continuously, resulting in the most favorable growth rate for your savings.

## API Integration

Integrate savings functionality into your applications using the MageBank API:

```javascript
// Example: Deposit to savings
const depositToSavings = async (agentId, amount) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.magebank.ai/savings/deposit', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      agentId: agentId,
      amount: amount
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};

// Example: Withdraw from savings
const withdrawFromSavings = async (investmentId) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.magebank.ai/savings/withdraw', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      investmentId: investmentId
    })
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};

// Example: Get savings dashboard data
const getSavingsDashboard = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.magebank.ai/savings/dashboard', {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
    }
  });
  
  return await response.json();
};
