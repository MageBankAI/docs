## How Interest Works

<Info>
**Continuous Compounding**: The Savings Vault uses continuous compounding, the most favorable interest calculation method, allowing your investments to grow at the maximum possible rate.
</Info>

The Savings Vault uses a compound interest model to grow your savings:

- **Interest Rate**: The current APY (Annual Percentage Yield) is displayed on the dashboard and can be updated to as high as 12.5%
- **Real-time Calculation**: Interest accrues continuously and is calculated in real-time
- **No Lock-up Period**: Funds can be deposited or withdrawn at any time without penalties
- **Interest Disbursement**: Interest is added directly to your investment's current value

### Interest Calculation

Your interest is calculated using the standard compound interest formula, which takes into account:

- Principal amount invested
- Annual interest rate (APY)
- Investment duration (including partial days)
- Continuous compounding methodology
