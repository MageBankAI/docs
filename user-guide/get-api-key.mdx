## Using Your API Key

Your API key must be included in all API requests to the server in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```javascript
// Example using fetch
const response = await fetch('https://api.magebank.ai/v1/agents', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-api-key': YOUR_API_KEY
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
```

## API Key Security Best Practices

Protecting your API key is critical - anyone with your key can perform actions on behalf of your account. Follow these security practices:

- **Never expose your API key in client-side code** - Always make API calls from your server
- **Don't store keys in code repositories** - Even private repositories can be compromised
- **Use environment variables** - Store your key in environment variables or a secure secrets manager
- **Restrict network access** - Limit API calls to specific IP addresses when possible
- **Rotate keys periodically** - Generate a new key and deprecate old ones on a regular schedule
- **Use dedicated keys for different environments** - Separate keys for development and production

## Regenerating Your API Key
