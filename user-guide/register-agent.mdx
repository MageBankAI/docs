## Creating a New Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrate Agent">
    Access the Integrate Agent section from the sidebar menu.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add New Agent">
    Click the "Add new agent" button in the top right corner to begin the agent creation process.

      <img src="/images/register-agent/add-new-agent-button.png" alt="Add New Agent Button" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill the KYA Form">
    The first step displays your current wallet balance and requires you to enter basic information about your agent:
    
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your agent
    - **Description**: Purpose and functionality of the agent
    - **Allocated Balance**: Amount to fund your agent (this will be deducted from your main wallet)
    - **Tags** (optional): Add up to 5 tags to categorize your agent

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Payment Rules">
    In the second step, you'll set transaction limits and approval requirements:
    
    - **Daily Limit**: Maximum amount the agent can spend in a single day
    - **Transaction Limit**: Maximum amount for a single transaction
    - **Require Approval Above Amount**: Transactions above this amount will require your manual approval
    - **Require Approval For All Transactions**: Toggle to require approval for all transactions regardless of amount

    </Frame>
    
    <Warning>
    **Security Consideration**: Carefully configure these limits based on your risk tolerance. Lower limits and approval requirements provide more security but may require more manual intervention.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Agent Registration">
    After clicking "Next", your agent will be created. The confirmation screen displays:
    
    - **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for your agent (copy this for API calls)
    - **API Key**: Your MageBank API key (same for all your agents)
    - **Balance**: The amount allocated to your agent
    - **Payment Rules**: Summary of all transaction limits and approval settings
    - **Updated Balance**: Your remaining wallet balance after funding the agent

    </Frame>
    
    <Warning>
      Keep your API key and Agent ID secure. These credentials provide access to your agent's funds and functionality.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Agent Configuration

### Balance Allocation

<Info>
**Blockchain Transfers**: When you create an agent, funds are transferred from your main wallet to the agent's dedicated blockchain wallet through a secure on-chain transaction.
</Info>

When you create an agent, you allocate funds from your main wallet to the agent's wallet. This amount is deducted immediately from your global balance and becomes available for the agent to use within its configured limits.

### Payment Rules

<Check>
**Transaction Control**: Payment rules provide granular control over how your agents can spend funds, allowing you to balance autonomy with security.
</Check>

Payment rules determine how your agent can spend funds:

1. **Daily Limit**: Restricts the total amount an agent can spend in a 24-hour period
2. **Transaction Limit**: Caps the size of individual transactions
3. **Approval Requirements**: Configure when you need to manually approve transactions:
   - Above a specific amount
   - For all transactions (regardless of amount)

### Tags

Tags help organize your agents and make them easier to find. You can add up to 5 tags per agent and use them to filter your agents list. Common tag examples include:

- Project names (e.g., "marketing", "development")
- Agent functions (e.g., "payments", "subscriptions")
- Business units (e.g., "finance", "operations")

## Using Your Agent

Once created, your agent can:

- Make payments to external accounts
- Transfer funds between other agents
- Automatically process transactions within set limits
- Request approval for transactions exceeding limits

For details on how to use your agent with the API, see the [API Reference](/api-reference/agents/introduction) documentation.

## Managing Agents

<Info>
**Central Dashboard**: All your agents can be monitored and managed from a single interface, giving you complete visibility of your automated financial operations.
</Info>

After creating agents, you can:

- View all your agents in the Agents dashboard
- Monitor their transaction history
- Modify payment rules
- Add or remove funds
- Deactivate agents when no longer needed
