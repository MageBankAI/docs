Create an AI agent to execute transactions and manage funds on your behalf. Agents can be configured with custom spending limits and approval requirements.

## Creating a New Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Integrate Agent">
    Access the Integrate Agent section from the sidebar menu.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add New Agent">
    Click the "Add new agent" button in the top right corner to begin the agent creation process.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill the KYA Form">
    The first step displays your current wallet balance and requires you to enter basic information about your agent:
    
    - **Name**: A descriptive name for your agent
    - **Description**: Purpose and functionality of the agent
    - **Allocated Balance**: Amount to fund your agent (this will be deducted from your main wallet)
      - Select from preset amounts or use the custom amount option
      - For custom amounts, enter a value and click "Set Amount"
    - **Tags** (optional): Add up to 5 tags to categorize your agent

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Payment Rules">
    In the second step, you'll set transaction limits and approval requirements:
    
    - **Daily Limit**: Maximum amount the agent can spend in a single day
    - **Transaction Limit**: Maximum amount for a single transaction
    - **Require Approval Above Amount**: Transactions above this amount will require your manual approval
    - **Require Approval For All Transactions**: Toggle to require approval for all transactions regardless of amount

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete Agent Registration">
    After clicking "Next", your agent will be created. The confirmation screen displays:
    
    - **Agent ID**: Unique identifier for your agent (copy this for API calls)
    - **API Key**: Your MageBank API key (same for all your agents)
    - **Balance**: The amount allocated to your agent
    - **Payment Rules**: Summary of all transaction limits and approval settings
    - **Updated Balance**: Your remaining wallet balance after funding the agent

    <Note>
      Keep your API key secure and never share it publicly. You'll need both the API key and Agent ID to make transactions with this agent.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding Agent Configuration

### Balance Allocation

When you create an agent, you allocate funds from your main wallet to the agent's wallet. This amount is deducted immediately from your global balance and becomes available for the agent to use within its configured limits.

<Note>
  It might take a few moments for the allocated funds to be fully transferred from your global account to the agent. During this time, you'll see the updated balances, but the blockchain transaction may still be processing.
</Note>

### Payment Rules

Payment rules determine how your agent can spend funds:

1. **Daily Limit**: Restricts the total amount an agent can spend in a 24-hour period
2. **Transaction Limit**: Caps the size of individual transactions
3. **Approval Requirements**: Configure when you need to manually approve transactions:
   - Above a specific amount
   - For all transactions (regardless of amount)

### Tags

Tags help organize your agents and make them easier to find. You can add up to 5 tags per agent and use them to filter your agents list. Common tag examples include:

- Project names (e.g., "marketing", "development")
- Agent functions (e.g., "payments", "subscriptions")
- Business units (e.g., "finance", "operations")

## Using Your Agent

Once created, your agent can:

- Make payments to external accounts
- Transfer funds between other agents
- Automatically process transactions within set limits
- Request approval for transactions exceeding limits

Access your agent in code using its unique Agent ID and your API key:

```javascript
// Example API call using your agent
const response = await fetch('https://api.magebank.ai/payments/register', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    senderagentid: 'agent_9LsHq7YUoDEuFrzBjO9paJ', // Your unique Agent ID
    receiveragentid: 'RECIPIENT_AGENT_ID',
    paymentdetails: {
      amount: 10,
      currency: 'USDC',
      method: 'CRYPTO_ADDRESS'
    },
    name: 'Payment description',
    type: 'EXTERNAL'
  })
});
```

## Managing Agents

After creating agents, you can:

- View all your agents in the Agents dashboard
- Monitor their transaction history
- Modify payment rules
- Add or remove funds
- Deactivate agents when no longer needed
