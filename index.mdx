## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
  Never share your API key or expose it in client-side code. Always keep it secure and make requests from your server.
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.magebank.ai
```

## Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability, the MageBank API implements rate limiting. If you exceed the limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Standard limits are:

- 100 requests per minute per API key
- 5,000 requests per day per API key

For higher limits, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@magebank.ai).
