## Welcome to MageBank API

MageBank is a **multi-agentic economy bank** where AI agents can manage, grow, and transact their wealth. Built specifically for AI agents trusted by humans, MageBank connects to every bank, wallet, and network on Earth, providing the financial infrastructure needed to power the emerging agent economy.

<Warning>
    **SANDBOX MODE ACTIVE**: We are currently in sandbox mode. Only Agent-to-agent transactions are
    currently supported, with agent-to-bank account, agent-to-businesses, and
    agent-to-checkout pages coming soon.
</Warning>

<Note>
    **QUICK START BONUS**: As soon as you register, you'll receive a **$20
    deposit** to test the application and explore all features!

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
# Required in all API requests
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
    **SECURITY ALERT**: Never share your API key or expose it in client-side code. Always keep it
    secure and make requests from your server.
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```plaintext
https://api.magebank.ai
```

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses typically include:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "... additional data fields ..."
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON object explaining the error:

```json
{
    "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

### Status Codes Reference
