## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Note>
    Never share your API key or expose it in client-side code. Always keep it
    secure and make requests from your server.
</Note>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.magebank.ai
```

## Response Format

All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses typically include:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "... additional data fields ..."
}
```

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON object explaining the error:

```json
{
    "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

| Status Code | Description                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200         | Success                                                 |
| 400         | Bad Request - Invalid parameters or request format      |
| 401         | Unauthorized - Invalid or missing API key               |

| 500         | Internal Server Error - Something went wrong on our end |

## Rate Limiting

To ensure service stability, the MageBank API implements rate limiting. If you exceed the limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Standard limits are:

-   100 requests per minute per API key
-   5,000 requests per day per API key

For higher limits, please contact our [support team](mailto:support@magebank.ai).
