## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Your API key should be included in all requests as an HTTP header:

```bash
# Required in all API requests
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
    **Security First**: Your API key grants complete access to your Mage account. Always handle it with the highest security standards and never expose it in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```plaintext
https://api.magebank.ai
```

## Response Format

<Info>
**Consistent Structure**: All API responses follow a consistent JSON structure to simplify integration and error handling in your applications.
</Info>

All API responses are returned in JSON format. Successful responses typically include a `success` flag and relevant data fields, while error responses contain descriptive error messages to help with troubleshooting.

## Error Handling

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON object explaining the error. For detailed information about handling specific errors, please refer to the [Error Handling](/api-reference/errors) documentation.
